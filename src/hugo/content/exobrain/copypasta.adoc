== The original Turboencabulator

For a number of years now, work has been proceeding in order to bring perfection
to the crudely conceived idea of a transmission that would not only supply
inverse reactive current for use in unilateral phase detractors,
but would also be capable of automatically synchronizing cardinal grammeters. +
Such an instrument is the turbo encabulator.

Now basically the only new principle involved is that instead of power being
generated by the relative motion of conductors and fluxes, it is produced by the
modial interaction of magneto-reluctance and capacitive diractance.

The original machine had a base plate of pre-famulated amulite surmounted by a
malleable logarithmic casing in such a way that the two spurving bearings were
in a direct line with the panametric fan. +
The latter consisted simply of six hydrocoptic marzlevanes,
so fitted to the ambifacient lunar waneshaft that side fumbling was effectively
prevented.

The main winding was of the normal lotus-o-delta type placed in panendermic
semi-boloid slots of the stator, every seventh conductor being connected by a
non-reversible tremie pipe to the differential girdle spring on the “up” end of
the grammeters.

The turbo-encabulator has now reached a high level of development,
and it’s being successfully used in the operation of novertrunnions. +
Moreover, whenever a forescent skor motion is required,
it may also be employed in conjunction with a drawn reciprocation dingle arm,
to reduce sinusoidal repleneration.

== The Macquarie Telecom SD-WAN Turbo Cloud Encabulator

For a number of years now, work has been proceeding in order to bring perfection
to the crudely conceived idea of an edge device that would not only supply
granular control packet transission for use in multi-lateral data networking
applications, but would also be capable of automatically binding and synchronizing
the asymmetric block-based storage elements.
Today we are proud to announce the launch of the SD-WAN Turbo Cloud Encabulator.

A hybridized new principle of this technology has been implemented where instead
of data being transported by relative protocols of multiple labels, switched
torward oscillating current, it is produced through the modial interaction of
amalgamatedly syn-aggregated packets.

The new architecture is designed on a framework of preextruded kubernetes
container orchestration, c-mounted by malleable logarithic relays in such a way
that the two sperving headers are in a direct line with the panametric cells
that reside on.

The latter consists simply of two, not six, distributional ornances so fitted to
the ambifacent ingress and egress points on the portal, so that the side-tunneling
of data is effectively eliminated.

Once the hypervisor has been initiated into the multi-tenanted multi-hybrid multi-cloud
devops have full access to the api, thus giving virtualized direct control of the
UCPE, VCPE, and other oversee layer seven deployments in a manner far simpler than
your standard containerization architectures.
The SD-WAN Turbo Cloud Encabulator has now reached a high level of development
and is being successfully used in the operation of reciprocous sites to reduce
synusodial giduration.

== Fubuki glasses

Glasses are really versatile. First, you can have glasses-wearing girls take
them off and suddenly become beautiful, or have girls wearing glasses flashing
those cute grins, or have girls stealing the protagonist's glasses and putting
them on like, "Haha, got your glasses!" That's just way too cute!
Also, boys with glasses! I really like when their glasses have that suspicious
looking gleam, and it's amazing how it can look really cool or just be a joke.
I really like how it can fulfill all those abstract needs. Being able to switch
up the styles and colors of glasses based on your mood is a lot of fun too!
It's actually so much fun! You have those half rim glasses, or the thick frame
glasses, everything! It's like you're enjoying all these kinds of glasses at a
buffet. I really want Luna to try some on or Marine to try some on to replace
her eyepatch. We really need glasses to become a thing in hololive and start
selling them for HoloComi.
Don't. You. Think. We. Really. Need. To. Officially. Give. Everyone. Glasses?
