== Create a self-signed TLS cert

* Create a private key (PEM encoded)

[shell]
--
openssl genpkey -algorithm ed25519 -out ssl.pkey
--

* To create a certificate we need to request one to a CA (in this case
* ourselves). Create a CSR (Certificate Signing Request), fill it
* (interactiverly) with details of the cert to generate and sign it with our
* private key.

[shell]
--
openssl req -new -key ssl.pkey -out csr
--

* (Wears the CA hat)
* Accept the CSR, generate the requested cert, make it last 1y, and sign it with our private key

[shell]
--
openssl x509 -req -in csr -signkey ssl.pkey -days 365 -out domain.crt
--
