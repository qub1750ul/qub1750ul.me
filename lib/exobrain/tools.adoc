== Database development

* https://github.com/schemaspy/schemaspy
  SchemaSpy is a database metadata analyzer. It helps your database administors
  and developers visualize, navigate and understand your data model.
  With an easy-to-use HTML-based report, traversing the entity-relationship
  diagram has never been simpler.

  SchemaCrawler is a free database schema discovery and comprehension tool.
  SchemaCrawler has a good mix of useful features for data governance. You can 
  search for database schema objects using regular expressions, and output the 
  schema and data in a readable text format. The output serves for database 
  documentation, and is designed to be diff-ed against other database schemas.
  SchemaCrawler also generates schema diagrams. You can execute scripts in any
  standard scripting language against your database. You can find potential
  schema design issues with lint.

== Secret scanning and leak prevention

  A nice scanning tool that can be integrated using Make  

== Hardware simulation

* https://github.com/buserror/simavr
  simavrÂ is an AVR simulator for linux, or any platform that uses avr-gcc.
  It uses avr-gcc's own register definition to simplify creating new targets for supported AVR devices. The core was made to be small and compact, and hackable so allow quick prototyping of an AVR project. The AVR core is now stable for use with parts with <= 128KB flash, and with preliminary support for the bigger parts. The simulator loads ELF files directly, and there is even a way to specify simulation parameters directly in the emulated code using an .elf section. You can also load multipart HEX files.
