An *exobrain*, or "second brain", or "brain dump" is something like
a public wiki where you can keep your bookmarks, notes, ideas and thoughts. +
Other people can search in your exobrain without having to physically
interact with you. The point is not to avoid physical interaction
altogether, but to scale collaboration and knowledge exchange with other
people.

It also allows for quicker iteration in writing blog posts or developing
thoughts - I can just quickly publish it here, share it gradually, and
receive immediate feedback.
