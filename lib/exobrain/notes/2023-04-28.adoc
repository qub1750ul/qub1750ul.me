== The case for biparted project structure ( build/src )

I always structure my projects in two main directories: build and src.
Build contains "dynamic", temporary, possibily auto-generated stuff.
Src contains human-made stuff.

This policy is quite rigid, with very few carefully considered exceptions.

Why ?


Let's say you want to take the lazy route and put everithing together without much regard.
