== Adding CoW capabilities to SQLite

* Using BTRFS snapshots ?
** Adds dependency on host system. May be necessary using a bundled BTRFS image.
   Is BTRFS-on-VFS supported ?
**** Apparently no, and for good reason: +
     link:https://btrfs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Hardware.html#storage-model +
	  With such configuration many assumptions BTRFS makes on storage will be broken.
	  Data corruption guaranteed on the long term.
	 
Someone built a SQLite-like DBMS with builtin CoW capabilities.
Interesting, but not stable and thus not trustable.
