== My gripes with NixOS
keyw:[nixos, package management, rant]

NixOS is a linux distribution based on Nix, a revolutionary package manager that fixes many fundamental issues of previous generation package managers such as APT and pacman.

While i myself am entusiastic about it, it has several issues that hinder its adoption, reducing it essentially to "Gentoo with extra steps":

* nix cli utilities are badly designed
* Too hard to downgrade packages
* Not actually reproducible
** Addressed by flakes?
