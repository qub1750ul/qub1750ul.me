== About OOP and theoretical technical righteousness

See Stroustup OOP. Because one influential person says something condivisible,
it is that "right" ?

Models are just models

Standards are so only if they get largely accepted

== Distinction among exobrain and blog

The Exobrain is a weakly structured blog without constraints on content.

The Blog is the place for curated essay-like documents.
A blog post should be at least three paragraphs long.
Paragraphs should be dense, about 10 periods.
Incorporates a lot of qualities typical of essays.
