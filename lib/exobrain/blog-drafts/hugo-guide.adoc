.Generating section indexes

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42868110/how-to-list-pages-in-current-section

You need to filter .Site.Pages by section using the where function. Try this:

```
<ul>
{{ range where .Site.Pages "Section" .Section }}
  <li>{{ .Title }}</li>
{{ end }}
</ul>
```

If you want to avoid empty lists, you can store the slice of section pages in a variable and check its length before you output the ul tags.

```
{{ $sectionPages := where .Site.Pages "Section" .Section }}
{{ if ge (len $sectionPages) 1 }}
  <ul>
    {{ range $sectionPages }}
      <li>{{ .Title }}</li>
    {{ end }}
  </ul>
{{ end }}
```
