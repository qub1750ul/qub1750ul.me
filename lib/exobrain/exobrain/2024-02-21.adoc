== Modal keyboard for Android

Editing exobrain on pc is fine, on mobile kinda dreadful.
Mostly because input methods are kinda limited in comparison to what i can do on vim with physical keyboard.

IDEA: Get a swipe-based softkeyb. Maybe has less friction?

What i really miss is easy modal interaction, that enables single-hotkey macros.

IDEA: Maybe F-keys can help?
