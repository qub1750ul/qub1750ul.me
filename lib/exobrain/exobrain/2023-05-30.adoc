== Lowering publishing friction

Separating the exobrain source from the website has been a great idea, using a
submodule to relink them a dumb one. +
The exobrain isn't something inherently versioned, only the latest version
matters at all. So using Git for this job brings nothing but worthless mental
overhead. +
I still had to manually sync the submodule in the website to the exobrain repo,
that in turn had to be _quite artificially_ be synced to the
authoritative copy.

Directly rsyncing the website copy from the authoritative one is a much simpler
and effective method to manage publication.
