== On removing "Hugo magic" from exobrain files

Currently to correctly render exobrain via Hugo, exobrain files need to include some Hugo-specific data.
Since this repository is not indended to be consumed by just Hugo in particular i was searching for a workflow alternative to "just plop files into a Hugo project", that being the very thing requiring "magic" to be there. +
For a variety of reasons this is quite challenging at the moment.

Today tho i come across https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/6098[this thread], that may provide a very interesting intermediate solution.
