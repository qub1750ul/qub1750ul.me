== Link stash curation

Basic curation of links can be automated. Tasks to do:
* Fetch and register title
* Fetch author info
* (MAYBE) Fetch summary
* Auto-snapshot using wayback-machine-like software

[TODO]
--
Build a link auto-curation toolkit:
* Should be partily usable in CI
** Explore keyw:Zuul CI as possible base platform
* Will need vim bindings for occasional interactive use

== Exobrain tags
[TODO]
--
Create a ADOC macro to generate global cross references (keyw)
* These should point to a generated index page for the specific keyword
