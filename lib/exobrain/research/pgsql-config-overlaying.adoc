title: "PGSQL config overlaying methods"
---

== Status of this Memo

== Abstract

These are research notes about solving a very specific problem:

- I need to patch a vendor-app-managed database with user code

=== Requirements

NOTE: This section SHOULD be interpreted as described in IETF RFC 2119 and relative errata.  
- The patch MUST be idempotently applicable and removable, without affecting system
  integrity.
- The (un)patching process SHOULD be easy to operate, e.g. by executing an Ansible 
  playbook. 
- Operation of the (un)patching process SHOULD bring the database in one of two possible
  configuration states, replicating respectively the following situations:  
	* The database has never been patched, and so matches vendor configuration  
	* The database has been patched from the start
